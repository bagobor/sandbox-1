Mountain Dew - 3D Graffiti
==========================

This OpenGL demo app reads the BVH file Drawing001.bvh and generates
a triangle mesh from the path. Controller rotation data is read but
is currently ignored as I found it didn't give results as good as the
parallel transport method for constructing a reference frame along a path.
A nice description of the paralle transport method is given in 
"Quaternion Gauss Maps and Optimal Framings of Curves and Surfaces (1998)", 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.50.8658).

Lighting is performed using a third order spherical harmonic ambient
term with a direct spot light and PCF filtered shadow mapping. The ambient
SH coefficients are calculated from Paul Debevec's HDR "beach" light probe.

The mesh is reconstructed from scratch each frame and nothing is
optimised so I expect it could be made significantly faster.
